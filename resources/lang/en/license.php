CONDITIONS FOR MAKING COPIES, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATIONS

This License Agreement applies to all software or other developed by JANICKY.COM, in which it is
indicated that the program may be distributed only under this license agreement.
The term \"software product\" , as used below, is applied to a program (development) and the term
\"development based on the Software product\" refers to either the software product, or any
development made on its basis, protected by copyright law.
This license agreement is addressed to you and enters into agreement with you.
This license agreement applies only to manufacturing copies, distribution and modification of the
software product. Other actions on Software product are beyond the scope of this license agreement.

1. It is permitted to copy and distribute replicas of the source code of Software product in the form in
which you received them, in any medium provided that each copy you supply with references to
copyright law and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact everything relating to this license agreement and
the absence of any warranty, and give the Software product to any third-party beneficiaries together
with a copy of the Software Product License agreement along with the Program.

2. You can make changes to your copy of the Software Product in any part of it, thus creating a
development on the basis of Software product, and copy and distribute such modifications or
developments under the conditions listed above in section 1, in case they also meet the following
conditions:

2.1 you must specify exactly which files have been changed, what was changed, and date of changes.

2.2 Any distributed or published developments that include the Software product entirely or any part of
it, made on the basis of the software product, or any part of it, must be mandatory licensed by you
according to the conditions of the present license agreement.

3. If a modified program is designed for interactive use, then at the beginning of the work with such
interactive use, the information has to be shown in a normal procedure about the presence and the
ability to view copyright notices and the absence (or presence provided by you) of guarantees that users
can according to this agreement transfer software product to other users, as well as instructions for the
user for how to view a copy of this license agreement.
These requirements apply to the modified development in general.
If logically isolated components of your design are not based on this Software product and can rightfully
be regarded as independent development, then this License and its conditions do not apply to the
components mentioned in those cases when you distribute them as separate development.
If these components are distributed as part of an integrated development based on the Software
product, then this license agreement is effective, permitting the licensing of this integral development,
and therefore, applicable to all and any of its parts, regardless of who is its author.

4. It is possible to make copies, modify, sublicense or distribute the Software product only subject to
the conditions expressly stated in this license agreement. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
sublicense or distribute the Software product are considered a violation of the license agreement and
will automatically terminate your rights provided by this agreement.
However, a license of third parties who received from you any copies or rights under this license
agreement will remain valid as long as such parties remain fully comply with the conditions of the
agreement.

5. You are not required to accept this License Agreement, since you have not signed it. However,
nothing else grants you a permission to modify or distribute the Software product or create any
developments on its basis. In this case, such actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this
License agreement.
Therefore, by modifying or distributing a copy of the Software product (or any work created based on
it), you thus show the acceptance of this License with all its terms and conditions for copying,
distributing or modifying the Software product or developments created on its basis.

6. Whenever you redistribute the Software Product (or development created based on the Product), the
new recipient automatically receives from the original licensor a right to copy, distribute or modify the
Software Product in accordance with the terms and conditions of this license agreement. You can not
impose any further restrictions on the rights of the new owner given to him by this license agreement.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this agreement.

7. In case of a court judgment or a copy infringement or for any other reason (not necessarily of patent
character), you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) are put in conditions that contradict
the conditions of this license agreements, this does not excuse you from the conditions of this license
agreement.
If you can not simultaneously perform your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
obligations, then as consequence you can not distribute the Software Product.
For example, if a patent license would not allow gratuitous further distribution of software products by
those who received a copy of it from you, directly or indirectly, then the only way not to violate any of
its conditions or conditions of this license agreement is to fully refrain entirely from distribution of the
Software Product.
If any part of this section is held to have no legal force or inapplicable in the circumstances, the rest part
of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is applicable to other circumstances.

8. If the distribution and/or use the Software Product in a specific country is limited by patent
agreements or relationships in the field of copyright, the original copyright holder who places his
software product under this License Agreement, can add a clearly defined geographical limitations for a
distribution, excluding these countries from those that allowed distribution. In such case, this License
agreement incorporates the limitation as if written in the actual text agreement.

9. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Software product into other freely distributed software
products, but under other conditions, you have to ask a permission in writing from the authors.
